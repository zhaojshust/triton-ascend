# Triton-Ascend Security Note

## System Security Hardening

You are advised to enable the address space layout randomization (ASLR) (level 2) in the system. You can perform the following operation to enable it:

    echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

## Suggestions on Running Users

To ensure security and minimize permissions, you are advised not to use administrator accounts such as **root**.

## File Permission Control

1. You are advised to take security measures such as permission control on sensitive files, such as personal privacy data and business assets. For details about how to set the permissions, see the "File Permission Reference" section.

2. During the installation and use, you are advised to control the permissions. For details about how to set the permissions, see [File Permission Reference](#file-permission-reference).

## Build Security Statement

Triton-Ascend can be installed through source code compilation. During the compilation process, dependent third-party libraries are downloaded and the shell build script is executed. This results in the generation of temporary program files and compilation directories. You can control permissions on files in the source code directory as required to prevent security risks.

## Public IP Address Statement

Public IP addresses are used in the configuration files and scripts of Triton-Ascend. For details, see the "Public IP Addresses" section.

##### Public IP addresses
| Type    | Open-Source Code Address                                                                                    | File Name                                     | Public IP Address/Public URL/Domain Name/Email Address                                                                | Description                         |
